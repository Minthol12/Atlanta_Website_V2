                <h2>Vision and Purpose</h2>
                <p>The Atlanta NewsCast project was developed to modernize the school's digital presence, offering students, staff, and the community a centralized, secure, and user-friendly portal for all critical information. Key features include a personalized Student Hub, a modular Admin Dashboard, a comprehensive How-To section, and a full-scale news and sports platform. The design prioritizes accessibility, mobile responsiveness, and a professional dark-mode aesthetic.</p>

                <h2>Technical Stack Highlights:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Front-End: Modern HTML5, Modular CSS (using variable themes for Dark/Light mode).</li>
                    <li>Interactivity: Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic elements (Countdown Timer).</li>
                    <li>Security: Implementation of strong security headers and CSP Nonce to defend against XSS attacks.</li>
                </ul>
